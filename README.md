# Four Week Frontend üë®‚Äçüíª

The Four Week Frontend challenge is a structured, 28-day coding adventure designed to help beginners establish and enhance their web development skills. Over the course of four weeks, participants will delve into a variety of projects that cover essential frontend technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each day presents a unique, manageable project that builds on the previous skills learned, culminating in a comprehensive portfolio of projects ranging from simple web pages to interactive applications. The challenge is designed for vanilla CSS / JS, but if you're learning a new framework this may serve as a great starting point!

This challenge is ideal for those looking to start a career in web development or simply enhance their coding skills. Each week focuses on different aspects of frontend development:

- **Week 1**: Focuses on HTML and CSS basics, laying the groundwork with projects like personal bios, recipe pages, and a daily planner.
- **Week 2**: Deepens HTML and CSS skills with more complex layouts and introduces basic JavaScript to enhance page interactivity.
- **Week 3**: Shifts towards JavaScript-intensive projects, helping participants understand how to manipulate the DOM and handle events.
- **Week 4**: Expands on JavaScript skills with API integration and complex functionality, rounding out the challenge with practical applications like a weather dashboard, a currency converter, and more.

The Four Week Frontend challenge is designed to fit around your life and commitments. While it's laid out as a 28-day program, you don't need to complete it in consecutive days. This challenge serves as a structured guide for those looking to build or enhance their frontend skills at their own pace. Whether you're filling gaps in your days, expanding your knowledge over weekends, or even spreading it out over several months, each project provides a step-by-step progression in web development. Use this challenge as your roadmap to a more rounded and robust frontend expertise whenever you find the time to code!
